This is a interactive wizard  to run rosetta ligand docking and GA ligand docking jobs.
There is also a collection of scripts for analysis and post processing. This is a work in progress
with updates and functionality to be added later. So far the ligand docking simulation side of
things works with analysis steps needing to be added.

To use this wizard copy over the following directories and files from this repository to your
seperate project folder:
input_files
intermediate_files
output_files
rosetta_runs
setup_rosetta_dock_env.sh

to use the wizard in your project directory use the following commands:
source setup_rosetta_dock_env.sh
$ROSETTA_DOCK/wizard.sh
